      <p>The RIT Electric Vehicle Team is a student run organization dedicated to promoting the viability
      of electric vehicles through real world demonstrations of electric drivetrains in action. The team
      aims to educate people on the principles of electric vehicle design by engaging students in
      challenging and rewarding projects that cover a wide variety of academic disciplines. </p>

      The team’s main project is to design, build, and race a high performance electric motorcycle for
      competition in the 2015 e MotoRacing all-electric race series. The current bike is based off of
      the frame from a 2005 Kawasaki Ninja ZX6RR, and utilizes two Zero Z-Force 75-7 motors paired
      with two Sevcon Size6 controllers. In house engineering includes the design and fabrication of a
      battery management system, battery containment modules, structural framing for the
      mounting of the powertrain, as well as advanced data collection and analysis software.
