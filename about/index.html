                The RIT Electric Vehicle Team is a student run organization
                dedicated to promoting the viability of electric vehicles through
                real world demonstrations of electric drivetrains in action. The
                team aims to educate people on the principles of electric vehicle
                design by engaging students in challenging and rewarding projects
                that cover a wide variety of academic disciplines.

            The teamâ€™s main project is to design, build, and race a high
            performance electric motorcycle for competition in the 2016
            eMotoRacing all-electric race series. The current bike is based off
            of the frame from a 2005 Kawasaki Ninja ZX6RR, and utilizes a Zero
            Z-Force 75-7 motor paired with a Sevcon Size 6 controller. In house
            engineering includes the design and fabrication of a battery
            management system, battery containment modules, structural framing
            for the mounting of the powertrain, as well as advanced data
            collection and analysis software.
